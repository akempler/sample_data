It was donated by Mrs. Celia Miller Fitch, the great-granddaughter of Dr. Marshall in memorial to her grandfather in December 1999. Dr. Marshall was the first practicing physician in the Platte City area and was a well respected resident of Platte City (then Martinsville) from 1837 to 1861.<br />\nThe area is located along North Farley Road approximately 2.5 miles north of Farley and&nbsp;three miles south of&nbsp;Highway 92. North Farley road provides the western boundary of the area with&nbsp;one-half mile of road frontage.<br />\nElevations range from 760 feet along the Platte River to over 890 feet in the hills. The area includes bottomland and upland forests as well as prairie and savanna areas that are being restored.<br />\nThe area is home to a variety of wildlife. Hunters can pursue rabbits, squirrel, quail, and turkey. Archers and muzzleloading firearm hunters will find fair numbers of deer on the area.<br />\nThe diversity of natural communities present on the area provide excellent opportunities for bird watching, nature study, wildlife viewing, and outdoor photography. \n",

Several brushy draws dissect the property, and a few fishless ponds can be found near the draws.\n\nThis prairie is maintained in a diverse plant community with a combination of prescribed burning and haying to reduce competition from woody species and to encourage forbs. \n\nMechanical removal of trees is also conducted to maintain the draws as brush rather than forest.  Quail and rabbits find this type of habitat fairly hospitable and a few deer reside here as well.",
