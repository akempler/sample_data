  "question": "Why did I receive a jury summons when I don't live at the address on the summons?",
  "answer": "Each year Colorado is required to create a new jury list. A list of names is created including voter records, drivers' licenses, non-driver ids, and state income tax records.

  "question": "Why do I receive jury summonses year after year, when other people don't?",
  "answer": "Since the summons process is random, there is no easy explanation to this question. Each name goes into the system with a different random number attached to it each year. In some counties with small populations, almost every qualified citizen will be called for jury service each year due to the number of jury trials requested."
